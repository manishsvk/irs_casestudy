/**
* 1. Currently LinkedIn OAuth Profile Api's does not provide full profile information 
* of users. Only basic information like name email etc. In order to access full profile 
* information we have to submit request to enroll in their partner program and then 
* they will evaluate our request. Hence this cannot be achieve in this duration.
* 
* 2. In order to get factual information from the resume by parsing the resume 
* document, as per my opinion we have to use natural language processing techniques
* which neither do i have expertise nor can be achieve in this short duration.
* 
* Therefore in order to proceed in this case study, i will randomly generate a score
* for each application so that our flow is complete.
